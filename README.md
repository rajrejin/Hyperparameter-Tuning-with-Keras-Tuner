Fashion MNIST Hyperparameter Tuning Project
Overview
This project focuses on building and optimizing a neural network model using TensorFlow, Keras Tuner, and Fashion MNIST dataset. The primary goal is to tune hyperparameters such as the number of layers, units per layer, dropout rate, and learning rate to achieve optimal performance.

Features
Dataset: Uses the Fashion MNIST dataset for classification tasks.
Custom Model Architecture:
Fully connected neural network with configurable hidden layers and units.
Normalization and dropout layers for regularization.
Hyperparameter Optimization:
Implements Bayesian Optimization via Keras Tuner for parameter tuning.
Custom tuning logic for batch size selection.
Early Stopping:
Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation accuracy.
Training:
Conducts training with the best hyperparameters determined during tuning.
Key Libraries
TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network.
Keras Tuner: For hyperparameter optimization.
Matplotlib: For visualization (if needed).
NumPy: For data manipulation.
Project Structure
Data Loading: Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
Model Creation:
A function create_model defines the architecture.
Configurable hyperparameters include:
Number of hidden layers
Number of units per layer
Dropout rate
Learning rate
Tuner Implementation:
Custom tuner (CustomTuner) extends kt.tuners.BayesianOptimization.
Tuning searches for optimal parameters in a defined range.
Training:
Trains the best model with a callback for early stopping.
Evaluation: Validates the model on test data.
Setup
Prerequisites
Install the following Python packages:

tensorflow
keras-tuner
matplotlib
numpy
Installation
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras-tuner matplotlib numpy
How to Run
Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Create and summarize the model architecture:
python
Copy code
create_model(None).summary()
Run the tuner to find optimal hyperparameters:
python
Copy code
tuner.search(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), epochs=5)
Train the model with the best hyperparameters:
python
Copy code
model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), epochs=20, batch_size=128)
Results
The model's architecture and hyperparameters can be viewed using:
python
Copy code
model.summary()
tuner.search_space_summary()
Achieved accuracy metrics for training and validation can be analyzed using the training history.
Future Work
Visualize the tuning results (e.g., hyperparameter impact on accuracy).
Experiment with other datasets or models.
Implement additional callbacks or regularization techniques.
